Explaining our project:

When tasked with coming up with a project, our group decided that now more so than ever a posture sensor would be of great benefit to most people in the world. With an influx of people working and studying from home, it has led to an increased period of timing sitting and often in compromising positions, often leading to back problems down the line.

The design we came up with features a touch sensor with a buzzer and an led light which combine to alert the user of their poor sitting position. When their back breaks contact from the touch sensor, the buzzer and led combo will go off, alerting them to return to a good posture position, back firmly supported by the chair. We also decided to make this system portable so that it can be used on many different chairs. For this we decided that our touch sensor should be placed on a velcro strap that simply wraps around any chair the user wants to sit on.
